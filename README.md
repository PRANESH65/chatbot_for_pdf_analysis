# chatbot_for_pdf_analysis
# FastAPI PDF Chatbot

This project demonstrates a FastAPI application that allows users to upload a PDF file, extract its text using PyMuPDF, and then generate an AI response using OpenAI's API.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/fastapi-pdf-chatbot.git
   cd fastapi-pdf-chatbot
Install dependencies:

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Then install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure openai and pyngrok are installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install openai pyngrok
Set up OpenAI API key:

Obtain an API key from OpenAI and replace "my_api_key" in main.py with your actual API key.

Usage
Run the FastAPI server:

Start the FastAPI server on localhost using uvicorn:

bash
Copy code
uvicorn main:app --host localhost --port 9000
The server will be accessible at http://localhost:9000.

Upload a PDF file:

Use any HTTP client (e.g., curl, Postman) to upload a PDF file to the /upload-pdf/ endpoint. Example using curl:

bash
Copy code
curl -X POST -F "file=@example.pdf" http://localhost:9000/upload-pdf/
Replace example.pdf with the path to your PDF file.

Interact with the API:

The server will extract text from the uploaded PDF file.
It will then call OpenAI's API to generate a response based on the query "What can you tell me about this PDF?".
You will receive a JSON response containing the original query, extracted PDF text, and AI-generated response.
